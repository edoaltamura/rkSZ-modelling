# rkSZ-modelling
The rotational kinetic Sunyae-Zel'dovich effect arises in presence of rotating ionised media, such as the Intra-Cluster Medium in galaxy clusters, or the Circum-Galactic Medium surrounding galaxies. This repository contains codes for the simulation and modelling of the rkSZ in different scenarios.
